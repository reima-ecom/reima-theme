<!-- 
  Order an array based on another array. The items not in the
  "ordering" array should be sorted so that numeric items
  come first and are numerically sorted, and the rest is
  sorted alphabetically.

  Example 1:
  We have an array [c a d] (array) that we want to order.
  The expected order is [a b c d] (order).
  This partial will return [a c d].

  Example 2:
  We have an array [d c a f] (array) that we want to order.
  The expected order is [a b c] (order).
  Note that the array contains items not in our ordering array,
  these we expect to be at the end of the returned array in the original order.
  This partial will return [a c d f]

  Expected input:
  
  - order
    Array with the expected order
    
  - array
    Original array to order accordingly

{{ $notordered := .array | complement $ordered }}
{{ $sorted := sort $notordered }}
