  description: Link url. Please use the full url only for external links. I.e. internal
    links should be "/products/a-product" and external links "https://www.google.com".
    <strong>Remember the preceding slash on internal links.</strong> (This is the
    way links work - with the preceding slash it tells the browser this is a link
    relative to the root of the site. Without the slash, the link is considered relative
    to the current page.)
