## Changes in 2020-08-21

**New status page**

The status page (this page!) will in the future include a log of changes, as well as a list of known bugs. Also, the theme is now more rigorously versioned, and you can see the version a site is running on on the status page.

## Changes in 2020-08-20

**New collection page design**

Collection pages now use the new design, and requires that collections have been imported with the new collection importer. The layout of the new collection page is the same as that for the "interstitial" page (i.e. it uses the same code).

**Other fixes**

- The `product list` module now displays all products from a collection by default. The number of products can however be limited if needed.

## Known bugs

- No description (copy) on collection pages
- No breadcrumb on collection pages
- Icon button (e.g. cart icon) focus outline not according to specification
- Checkbox-based open buttons (e.g. menu icon and collection page filters) not tabbable
- Product card color dots not according to specification - dots get "squished" if there are too many of them (see toddlers collection vantti on Canada site)
