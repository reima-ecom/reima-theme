## Content management help

For details on how content works, see [content management help](/content-management-help).

## Updates and changes

The release versions and changes between each release are [available at GitHub](https://github.com/reima-ecom/reima-theme/releases). The version in use is updated if needed when the site is published. This means that after there is a release in GitHub and a publish is initiated (e.g. by updating content), the version is updated to the latest released version. (Updates are not automatic for [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) major releases.)

## Theme demo

See the [demo site](https://reima-demo.netlify.app) for a showcase of the current theme. Note that this site might not be running the latest version of the theme.
