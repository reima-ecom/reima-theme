        "content": "Jacket and color is exactly as pictured. It is light, thick as a fleece and has a sweater look/feel on the outside. It will work as a mid layer in winter and on it&#x27;s own at warmer time. Only complaint is that the zipper on ours is hard to get started for my five year old and even me. Ideally, I would like for the jacket to have a hood. But overall very good quality and sizing is spot on.",
