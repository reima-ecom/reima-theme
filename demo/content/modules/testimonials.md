  - text: We put the kids in these Taival Merino wool baselayers from Reima (our new
      favorite kids’ outdoor wear company from Finland). They were super warm, wicked
      away sweat, and the girls refused to take them off for 72 hours. I highly recommend
      them...The kids [also] loved [Reima's beanies] because they are so warm. I love
      them because they come in different sizes which avoided that horrible tendency
      of hats to slide down kid’s faces when they are active.

      An innovative new kids' jacket has launched this week. Designed by Finnish company [Reima](https://us.reima.com), the wind- and rain-proof Voyager jacket is described as 'fully recyclable' because it is made from a single material – polyester – that need not be separated from other materials in order to be properly recycled...

      Reima is doing smart design work and is worth supporting for that reason alone.
