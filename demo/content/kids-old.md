    ## It Takes All Sorts: Kids’ Clothes at Reima

    At Reima, we have everything you need to keep kids smiling when they’re embracing the great outdoors. From lightweight mid-layers to waterproof jackets, we’re a one-stop shop for active childrenswear.

    Encourage all that energy with clothes designed for comfort: details on our pieces include flat-lock seams to minimise chafing and baby clothing with padded bottoms for babies who love to wriggle around in the snow.

    ## Scandi Style with Reima Kids’ Clothing

    As a Finnish brand that’s thrived since 1944, we mastered Scandinavian design a long time ago. Nowadays, we focus on creating boys and girls’ clothes in joyful colours and prints. For the latest season, our kids’ outfits are just as fun and fashionable as always. Check out our collections for a rainbow of shades, as well as colour-popping patterns and prints, whether your shopping for older girls or searching for baby girl clothes.

    ## The Big-Ticket Items: Reima Kids’ Clothes

    At Reima we’re known for our snowsuits and ski gear – and for good reason. Ever since we first started turning tough military clothing into weather-defying kids’ products, we’ve continuously built on our collections, improving items with the use of high-tech materials and handy features. We even developed the Reimatec line, which thrives in temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius so kids can play outside even in Baltic breezes.
