    do it all: it's great for sports, great for hikes, easy to slip on and off, and
    best of all, can be washed in the washing machine on a normal cycle. These breathable
    shoes can be worn with or without socks and are great shoes to wear out and about,
    or just lounging around. \n\n"

    products are free from PVC''s, which are bad for the environment and your kids.
    We also make products that last, which reduces your carbon footprint because that
    snowsuit you bought for your oldest kid still works for your youngest kid 6 years
    later. We create mono-material clothing that can be fully recycled into new clothing
    and even used recycled water bottles to create our swimwear. We make clothes that
    are meant for and designed for kids because isn''t that the way it should be? '

  - quote: We put the kids in these Taival Merino wool baselayers from Reima (our
      new favorite kids’ outdoor wear company from Finland). They were super warm,
      wicked away sweat, and the girls refused to take them off for 72 hours. I highly
      recommend them...The kids [also] loved [Reima's beanies] because they are so
      warm. I love them because they come in different sizes which avoided that horrible
      tendency of hats to slide down kid’s faces when they are active.

  - quote: An innovative new kids' jacket has launched this week. Designed by Finnish
      company Reima, the wind- and rain-proof Voyager jacket is described as 'fully
      recyclable' because it is made from a single material – polyester – that need
      not be separated from other materials in order to be properly recycled... Reima
      is doing smart design work and is worth supporting for that reason alone.
