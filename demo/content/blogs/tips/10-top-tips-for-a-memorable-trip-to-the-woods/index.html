      "imageCaption": "2. Have a go at landscape painting. Pack watercolours with you and unleash the kids’ creativity. The subject matter can be anything. Our wild guess is that it’ll be something surprising."

      "imageCaption": "3. Hunt for treasures. A treasure hunt is always entertaining, even more so when it’s made into a family competition. Points for the coolest bit of wood, the most stunning stone and the loveliest leaf! "

      "imageCaption": "4. Make organic art. Stones and leaves are superb material for sculptures, which can be painted and scented with different berries. The adult’s job is to keep the artists away from poisonous ones. "

      "imageCaption": "6. Build nests for animals. A hedgehog or a shrew will be delighted to find a ready-made nest build by your child. If the home is still empty on the next trip, no worries – the animals must have gone for a walk."
