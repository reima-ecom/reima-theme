# Shopify importer

Deno scripts used for importing products and collections from Shopify and product images from the media bank into a format that the Hugo site understands.

## Usage

Run the main `cmd.ts` with Deno to see usage instructions (`deno run cmd.ts`).

## Details

The Shopify configuration is picked up from the `config.yml` file. See the source code for more information, it is much easier to keep documentation in sync there.
